 * There are two kinds of command executers: SyncCommandExecuter and AsyncCommandExecuter.
 * SyncCommandExecuter: those are executed within the CommandManager's main thread context, they do not allow communications and shall return in a few milliseconds
 * AsyncCommandExecuter: those are executed in a separate thread, allow communications and may take long periods of time to execute.
