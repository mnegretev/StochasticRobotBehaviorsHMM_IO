To see the results of the evolved state machine usin the gui interface
and Octave, for instance to see invidual 1098:

Human programed
1. HMM_HUMAN: fitness_hmm_human, hmm_1098
2. FSM_HUMAN: fitness_state_machine_human, fsm_1098

Trained
3. HMM_VITERBI: fitness_hmm_viterbi, hmm_viterbi_1098

Evolved
4. FSM_GENETIC: fitness_best_fsm, best_fsm_1098
5. FSM_NN_GEMETIC: fitness_best_nn, best_nn_1098
6. HMM_GENETIC: FITNESS_BEST, best_1098


Directory original_data has a set of files necessary to include in the data directory.

File Constants.dat contains constants that can be modified to change the 
fitness function.

The file random_settings_advance_angle_sensors.dat contains the settings for
noise generation.
