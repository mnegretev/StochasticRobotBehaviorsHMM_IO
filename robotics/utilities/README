File ~/robotics/data/random_settings_advance_angle_sensors.dat is used to generate the noise that it is added to
the variables for movements, rotations and sensors.

The first row contains the settings for the advance variable, the first number (1) indicates a Gaussian random
variable, the second indicates the mean (0.0) and the third the variance (0.1)
The second row contains the settings for the rotation variable, the first number (0) indicates an uniform random
variable, the second and third indicates the uniform's range (-0.02, 0.02)
The third row contains the settings for the sensor variable, the first number (0) indicates an uniform random
variable, the second and third indicates the uniform's range (-1.0, 1.0)

1 0.0 0.1
0 -0.02 0.02
0 -1.0 1.0
